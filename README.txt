This is my hack of the excellent and beautiful terminus font (http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/) to include vim-powerline symbols and a 12px bold version.

This repo only includes the 12x6 pixel bitmap version, because that's the only version I care about.

Fair warning, the bold version is optimized for readability, not beauty. It's creation required several serious typographic crimes, which is probably why the author doesn't supply a bold version on this size.

Install as per your OS. On Linux, you'll want to read up on "xset fp", "xfontsel", and "fontconfig".
